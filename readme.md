Overview:

- Basic web page leveraging HTML and CSS to create a sleek UI with a flipping card effect.

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
  - transform: rotateY(180deg);
  - transition: transform .6s;
  - tranform-style: preserve-3d;
  - backface-visibility: hidden;
  - hover, transform: rotateY(180deg)
  - It would be best to understand how these different rules work in tandem together

Features:

- card that flips when the cursor hovers over it, revealing further information about a product

Challenges:

- I don't have the properly sized assets.  The tutorials turn out best when they provide the proper assets for the job.  Which, perhaps is asking too much?  But I feel that would be the closest approximation to a real world corporate environment.  Plus, I'm trying to learn specific skills here,(HTML, CSS) not trying to comb the internet for matching assets. I've done that before and it's hugely derailing.

Future Development:

- I probably won't develop this page any further, but may reference it in case future project require similar features.
- I would like to try this again with assets that actually match the desired webpage.
